- Hi, I’m Peter
- I’m interested in cybersecurity
- I’m currently learning wireshark and other related tools used in a SOC
- You can reach me through my email or LinkedIn
- Began my journey in 2023. I took a 3 week intro class, then self taught and passed the CompTIA Security+ certification, on the first attempt.
- Now I'm trying to learn everything I can to get into a SOC position.
